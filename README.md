1. Predictive Risk Detection: Identifies early warning signals using historical and real-time data

2. Data-Driven Insights: Transforms raw business data into actionable intelligence

3. Anomaly Detection: Flags unusual patterns that may indicate future problems

4. Scalable Analytics Pipeline: Designed to handle structured business datasets efficiently

5. Decision Support: Helps stakeholders mitigate risks before they impact operations


# 🧠 Tech Stack

1. Python

2. Pandas, NumPy

3. Scikit-learn

4. Data Visualization (Matplotlib / Seaborn / Power BI / Tableau – if applicable)

5. SQL (for data extraction and analysis)

# 📊 Use Cases

1. Financial risk monitoring

2. Operational failure prediction

3. Customer churn early detection

4. Supply chain disruption alerts

5. Business performance monitoring

# 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this project is to build an intelligent analytics system that acts as an early warning mechanism, enabling organizations to anticipate risks and respond proactively rather than reactively.
